Good documentation of the project and the application.

Your Experiments section is lacking a bit.
You say you did a lot of testing of the features and requirements but
_how_ did you go about doing so? What were the steps in your methods? 
What concrete results and values did you get and what conclusions could
you draw from them?

Try separating the different experiments into their own subsections.

Keep up the hard work!
